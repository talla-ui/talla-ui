/**
 * An object that represents an event, to be emitted on a {@link ManagedObject}
 *
 * @description
 * Events can be emitted on instances of {@link ManagedObject}, and handled using a callback passed to {@link ManagedObject.listen()} or {@link ManagedObject.attach()}.
 *
 * In most cases, instances of ManagedEvent are created by {@link ManagedObject.emit()} itself, when provided with just the event name and data (if any). When handling events, the implicitly created ManagedEvent will be passed to the handler.
 *
 * **Types** — Events are identified by their name at runtime. In the application source code, a specific event can be identified using the type arguments of ManagedEvent. These refer to the source object type and data object, respectively — e.g. `ManagedEvent<MyView, { foo: number }>`, which is a type definition for an event emitted by instances of MyView, with name Foo and a data object that includes a `foo` number property.
 *
 * **Change events** — The {@link ManagedObject.emitChange()} method can be used to emit events with a `change` property in the data object. This is a common pattern for notifying listeners about changes in the object's state, and will also trigger bindings to update the value of any bound properties.
 *
 * **Delegation** — An object may handle an event by emitting a new event with the same name, referencing itself as the delegate object. This is useful for forwarding events from one object to another, or for handling events in a different context, and is implemented automatically using the `delegate` option in the {@link ManagedObject.attach()} method. The delegate object can be accessed on any event using the {@link findDelegate()} method.
 *
 * **Event aliases** — Using preset objects passed to a view builder (i.e. using {@link ui} functions such as `ui.button()` or JSX tags), event names can be aliased to other event names. In the corresponding activity or view composite, the event can be handled using the aliased name. Refer to the example below.
 *
 * @example
 * // Emitting an event from a managed object
 * let obj = Object.assign(new ManagedObject(), { foo: "bar" });
 * obj.emit("Foo");
 * obj.emit("Foo", { baz: 123 })
 *
 * @example
 * // Handling events from an attached object
 * class MyObject extends ManagedObject {
 *   constructor() {
 *     super();
 *     this.foo = this.attach(new Foo(), (e) => {
 *       // ... handle event on attached foo object
 *     })
 *   }
 *   foo: MyFooObject;
 * }
 *
 * @example
 * // Handling delegated UI events
 * const BodyView = (
 *   ui.list(
 *     { items: $activity("items") }
 *     ui.row(
 *       // ...
 *       ui.button("Remove", { onClick: "RemoveItem" })
 *     )
 *   )
 * )
 * class MyActivity extends Activity {
 *   // ...
 *   items: SampleData[];
 *   onRemoveItem(e: ViewEvent) {
 *     let item = UIListView.getSourceItem(e.source, SampleData)
 *     // ...here:
 *     // item refers to the SampleData object
 *     // e.source refers to a button
 *   }
 * }

/**
 * A base class that represents a view which controls an attached body view
 *
 * @description
 * Component views are view objects that may include their own state (properties) and event handlers, to render their own view body content.
 *
 * To be able to use component views in the view hierarchy, you should also export a builder function that uses {@link ComponentViewBuilder} to create a builder object.
 *
 * For views that require a custom renderer (e.g. a platform-dependent graphic), define a view class that extends {@link ComponentView}, and overrides the {@link ComponentView.render} method altogether.
 *
 * @note Component views are very similar to {@link Activity} objects, but they don't have an active/inactive lifecycle and typically don't include any application logic (especially not for loading or saving data).
 *
 * @example
 * // Define a component view class to store view state
 * export class CollapsibleView extends ComponentView {
 *   expanded = false;
 *   onToggle() {
 *     this.expanded = !this.expanded;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Export a builder function that uses the class
 * export function Collapsible(title: StringConvertible, ...content: ViewBuilder[]) {
 *   return {
 *     ...ComponentViewBuilder(CollapsibleView, (v) =>
 *        UI.Column(
 *          UI.Label(title)
 *            .icon(v.bind("expanded").then("chevronDown", "chevronNext"))
 *            .cursor("pointer")
 *            .onClick("Toggle"),
 *          UI.ShowWhen(v.bind("expanded"), UI.Column(...content)),
 *        ),
 *     ),
 *     expand(expanded = true) {
 *       this.initializer.set("expanded", expanded);
 *       return this;
 *     },
 *   };
 * }

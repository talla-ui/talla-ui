 * A class that encapsulates a dynamic view
 *
 * @description
 * View composites contain a single (attached) view object. ViewComposite instances are themselves also views, and as such can be included in a view hierarchy or used as the view object of an {@link Activity}. When rendered, view composites display the contained body view object.
 *
 * The encapsulated view is referenced by the {@link ViewComposite.body body} property, which is usually set automatically, either when the ViewComposite is instantiated or right before rendering. It may be changed or unlinked at any time; the rendered view will be updated accordingly by the ViewComposite itself.
 *
 * Since the view is attached to the ViewComposite object, bindings continue to work, and events can be handled either by the ViewComposite object or by a containing object.
 *
 * View composites are primarily used in two different ways:
 *
 * - As a way to _control_ an encapsulated view. Refer to e.g. {@link UIConditionalView} and {@link UIListView}, which are built-in ViewComposite classes.
 * - As a way to create reusable view structures. Refer to the static {@link define()} method which can be used to create a ViewComposite class using a function and/or a class.

	 *
	 * @param defaults A set of default property values to be applied to each instance of the view composite.
	 * @param defineView A {@link ViewBuilder} object, or a function that returns a view builder; the view builder is used to create the view content for each instance of the view composite.
	 * @returns A new class that extends `ViewComposite`, with a constructor that takes a single preset object argument with a type that matches the provided defaults object.
	 *
	 * @description
	 * This method creates a new class that extends {@link ViewComposite}, which encapsulates and renders a contained view. The constructor of the resulting class takes a single object argument, a preset object, which is applied to the instance at first — setting properties, applying bindings, and adding event aliases.
	 *
	 * The resulting class can be used as a JSX tag on its own, with attributes corresponding to the properties of the (default) preset object, or it can be used with the {@link ui.use()} function. In both cases, the result is a {@link ViewBuilder} object.
	 *
	 * @note Note that while view _composites_ and view _activities_ are very similar, as a rule, view composites should not include any business logic (in event handlers or other methods). Hence, use this function only to define groups of UI elements and determine their look and feel. Where more code is required, consider either view activities, or view models that can be passed around in your code.

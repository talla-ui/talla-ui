/**
 * A class that encapsulates custom view content
 *
 * @description
 * Custom views are view objects that may include their own state (properties) and event handlers, to render their own content.
 *
 * When defining a reusable custom view, you should export a builder function that calls and returns the result of the static {@link CustomView.builder} method. The builder function can be used from a parent view builder, and will return a builder object that can be extended with custom methods.
 *
 * For views that require a custom renderer (e.g. a platform-dependent graphic), define a view class that extends {@link CustomView}, and overrides the {@link CustomView.render} method altogether. In this case, the view builder should not include any content.
 *
 * @note Custom views are very similar to {@link Activity} objects, but they don't have an active/inactive lifecycle and typically don't include any application logic (especially not for loading or saving data).
 *
 * @example
 * // Define a basic custom view
 * export const MyTitle = (title: StringConvertible) =>
 *   CustomView.builder(() => UI.Label(title).labelStyle("title"));
 *
 * @example
 * // Defined a basic custom view with additional builder methods
 * export function MyTitle(title: StringConvertible) {
 *   let width: BindingOrValue<number | undefined>;
 *   return CustomView.builder(() => UI.Label(title).labelStyle("title").width(width), {
 *     width(w: BindingOrValue<number | undefined>) {
 *       width = w;
 *     },
 *   });
 * }
 *
 * @example
 * // Define a custom view using a class to encapsulate view state
 * export class CollapsibleView extends CustomView {
 *   expanded = false;
 *   onToggle() {
 *     this.expanded = !this.expanded;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Export a builder function that uses the class
 * export function Collapsible(title: StringConvertible, ...content: ViewBuilder[]) {
 *   return CollapsibleView.builder(
 *     () =>
 *        UI.Column(
 *          UI.Label(title)
 *            .icon(bind("expanded").then("chevronDown", "chevronNext"))
 *            .cursor("pointer")
 *            .intercept("Click", "Toggle"),
 *          UI.ShowWhen(bind("expanded"), UI.Column(...content)),
 *        ),
 *     {
 *       expand(expanded = true) {
 *         this.initializer.set("expanded", expanded);
 *       },
 *     },
 *   );
 * }

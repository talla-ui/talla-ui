 * A view object that renders and controls a referenced view
 *
 * @description A `UIShowView` object renders its contained view object, when the {@link when} property is equal to true, and the {@link unless} property is equal to false.
 *
 * The contained view object can be created from a view builder, or referenced using a binding. In the latter case, the view object is not directly attached to the `UIShowView` object, but must be attached to another object, such as an activity.
 *
 * In addition, the `UIShowView` object can be used to play animations when the view is shown or hidden, or repeatedly.
 *
 * @online_docs Refer to the online documentation for more information on using this UI element class.
